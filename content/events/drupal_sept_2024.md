In this presentation, Stan Ascher will dive into the ECA (Event-Condition-Action) module in Drupal, 
offering a concise summary of its functionality and potential. We will explore how this powerful 
tool allows both business users and developers to design and implement business logic directly 
through an accessible user interface. Through real-world examples, you’ll see how the ECA module 
simplifies the creation of dynamic workflows and automations, making it an essential asset for 
Drupal site management. Developer Stan Ascher will demonstrate the power of the ECA module 
by showcasing site automations once handled by the Rules module in Drupal 7.
