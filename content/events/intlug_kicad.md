KICad is a CAD system for electronic circuit design. It's an Open Source project that can do what very expensive proprietary EDA (Electtronic Design Automation) software such as ADS by Keysight, Altium Designer and Circuit Maker by Altium, EAGLE by Autodesk, EasyEDA (hosted in China) and a lot more. $10k per year per user is common.

KiCAD EDA has existed for decades - was released in 1992! As an EDA, there are far too many functions to go over them all in a presentation - we'll focus on Schematics and PCB layout/design so you can have PCBs created based on your design.

The talk is planned to take less than 2 hours - we'll have plenty of time to talk about "anything Linux" too.

* When: 3 August 2024, 10am to Noon US-ET
* Where: Online - [Meetup Link](https://www.meetup.com/international-linux-users-group/events/301114104/)
