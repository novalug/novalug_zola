NoVaLUG is an all-volunteer, informal group with no budget. Everything we use is either donated or free.
Due to price increases, NoVaLUG will be dropping its Meetup.com subscription.
It is simply unaffordable.

That said, we would like to keep in touch with you. And if you would like to keep getting meeting
notifications, there are many other outlets we use to announce our meetings.

* [Mailing List](https://links.novalug.org/list)
* [Mastodon / Fediverse](https://links.novalug.org/masto)
