We are a curious, informal, and friendly mix of IT professionals, hobbyists, students, and 
others with an interest in Linux, Free and Open Source software, and open knowledge. 
The Northern Virginia Linux Users Group (NoVaLUG) is the oldest LUG in the Northern VA area and 
likely in the whole of US, established in 1993. 

Many thanks to those who came before us: John Kennedy, Peter Larsen, Mark Fearer, and Greg Pryzby.

## What's with the Penguin?

Tux, Linux Torvald's personal mascot, is the official brand character of the Linux kernel. 
Originally created as an entry to a Linux logo competition, Tux is the most commonly used icon 
for Linux, although different Linux distributions depict Tux in various styles. The character, 
also commonly called the Linux mascot, is used in many other Linux programs and as a general 
symbol for Linux. [Ref: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux_(mascot))]
