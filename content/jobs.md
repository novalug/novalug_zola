title = "Jobs"

A ghost job is a posting for a job that does not really exist. They are annoying
and waste the time of job-seeking applicants. Ghost jobs exist on nearly all
job listing platforms. While ghost jobs are not new, they have become a very
big problem recently.

NoVaLUG maintains a "jobs" room/channel in our [matrix](@/participate/matrix.md)
and [discord](@/participate/discord.md) servers where participants are encouraged
to post relevant and real jobs.
