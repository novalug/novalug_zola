The Fediverse (sometimes referred to as Mastodon) is a collection of interconnected social media
platforms. [NoVaLUG runs an instance](https://akk.novalug.org) that is available to any NoVaLUG participant, in addition
to using the instance to make announcements.

##  Obtaining an Account

Accounts on this server are limited to participants of NoVaLUG.
Use this [link](https://akk.novalug.org/registration/TYQ191BZpP1-4YUlJpQfLRGorHYqpAkR9vJWePJ9h7g=) to create
an account.

## NoVaLUG Accounts

In addition to accounts for participants, there are two accounts for NoVaLUG announcements:

* [@novalug@novalug.org](https://akk.novalug.org/novalug) - General announcements.
* [@meetings@novalug.org](https://akk.novalug.org/meetings) - Meeting announcements and reminders.
* [@tech-news@novalug.org](https://akk.novalug.org/tech-news) - Curated news on technical subjects.

## Service Information
Users on this server may be referred to with the novalug.org domain name (e.g. "foo@novalug.org" or "@foo@novalug.org").
However, when using URLs, the full hostname of akk.novalug.org must be used (e.g. "https://akk.novalug.org/foo").

To use this server with other clients, such as mobile apps, use the full host name of `akk.novalug.org`.

## Clients

In general, clients that work with Mastodon also work with Akkoma but this isn't always the case.
Please visit this page for [a list of Akkoma clients](https://docs.akkoma.dev/stable/clients/).

Specifically for iOS, "MetaText" works well with Akkoma.

## Content

In addition to content that naturally flows to the NoVaLUG instance via federation, our instance
also subscribes to a number of relays to pull in technical topics relevant to Linux and open
source software.
