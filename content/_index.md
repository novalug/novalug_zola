We are a curious, informal, and friendly mix of IT professionals, hobbyists, students, and 
others with an interest in Linux, Free and Open Source software, and open knowledge. 
The Northern Virginia Linux Users Group (NoVaLUG) is the oldest LUG in the Northern VA area and 
likely in the whole of US, established in 1993.
