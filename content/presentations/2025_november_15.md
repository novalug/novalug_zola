While Java has long been a staple of Enterprise, back-end development, it is
not typically thought of as a language to be used to create command-line interfaces
(those programs you use to in a terminal emulator). All that has changed with the
GraalVM.

Ed MacDonald, head of the Department of Geekanomics at Solution Street, will present
and demonstrate the creation of executable, command-line interfaces written in Java.

_Meeting Details:_
* When: 15 November 2025, 10am to Noon
* Where: [Solution Street, Herndon VA](/meetings/location-solutions-street).
