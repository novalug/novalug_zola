Build a public safety radio scanner for under $100 using the Raspberry Pi 4. 
Discover what digital trunked radio is and how to set up hardware and software on the RPi 4 to decode Project 25 radio traffic and stream to an icecast server. The icecast server, running on a separate Linux system provides client access to the stream and archives the streams using systemd timers/services. Connect over WiFi with VLC to the Icecast server and listen live to public safety radio traffic. At this meeting, Rich will share his experiences assembling and operating this method.
