Presenter(s): Greg Kurtzer, R. Leigh Hennig

With the EOL of CentOS 8 coming this year and transition to a rolling release model, Greg Kurtzer is initiating the Rocky Linux Project, a free, community-run drop-in replacement for CentOS and RHEL. Greg is original founder of the CentOS.

After a whirlwind start of 3 months of infrastructure building, the first release candidate of Rocky Linux is expected by 31 March 2021; the official release is expected in mid-2021.

Greg and Leigh will speak and answer questions on:

* The formation and status of Rocky Linux,
* Address questions that sysadmins might have about migrating a CentOS system to Rocky Linux, and,
* How users can contribute to the success of the Project.
