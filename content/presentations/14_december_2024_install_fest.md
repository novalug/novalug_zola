This meeting is intended to be more of a social event than a presentation.
We'll be doing a swap meet, installfest, and geek t-shirt contest.
* Swap meet: bring gear you don't use and trade with others.
* Installfest: Bring some hardware and we'll see if we can install Linux on it. Also, if you have things you'd like to show off, bring them.
* Geek T-shirt Contest: Does this really need explaining? There will be prizes.

_Meeting Details:_
* When: 14 December 2024, 10am to Noon
* Where: See our [meetings page](/meetings).
* iCal: [.ics](/ics/novalug-dec-24.ics)
