For years, Linux hobbyists interested in games always had to dual-boot into Windows
or have separate gaming rigs. No more. Gaming on Linux is a thing.

Our presenter (and longtime NoVaLUG participant), Tim Montgomery will show that
Linux is a viable gaming platform.

_Meeting Details:_
* When: 18 October 2025, 10am to Noon
* Where: [Solution Street, Herndon VA](/meetings/location-solutions-street).
