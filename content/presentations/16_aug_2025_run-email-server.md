Some believe running your own email server in 2025 is crazy.
Come listen to RK "Kirby" Thorton convince you otherwise with
Mail-in-a-Box.

Mail-in-a-Box lets you become your own mail service provider in a
few easy steps. It’s sort of like making your own gmail, but one you control from top to bottom.

Technically, Mail-in-a-Box turns a fresh cloud computer into a
working mail server. But you don’t need to be a technology expert to set it up.
