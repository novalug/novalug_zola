Overcome frustrations, when writing bash and Make, without looking at stackoverflow. Frustrated with python? Wish something was there to enable instant feedback when developing scripts? Finding that python isn't as easy as it seems? Tearing your hair out with python package management?

Rahul will introduce Clojure, a language that was not made for scripting — now made possible with Babashka.
Learn how the Clojure Babashka ecosystem makes scripting and programming a much better experience — imagine a world without need for stackoverflow!
