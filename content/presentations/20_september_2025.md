The Fediverse is an open source, decentralized set of various but interconnected
social media sites and applications. A lot of people know The Fediverse simply as

This presentation will cover the various aspects of The Fediverse, and will
discuss NoVaLUG's own foothold in this social network, <https://akk.novalug.org>.
